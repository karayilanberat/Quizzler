# Quizzler

## Overview

Quizzler is a trivia quiz app designed to enhance your knowledge across various fields with a series of multiple-choice questions. This project showcases the implementation of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern, which is a widely recognized pattern in mobile app development.

## Features

- Interactive multiple-choice trivia questions.
- Dynamic update of UI elements like labels and buttons.
- Implementation of MVC design pattern.
- Data management using Swift Structures and Classes.
- Simple and clean user interface.

## Learning Objectives

Throughout the development of Quizzler, I have achieved the following learning objectives:

- **Programmatic UI Changes:** Learned how to dynamically update labels and buttons in the user interface.
- **Design Patterns:** Gained a deep understanding of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern and its application in iOS development.
- **Swift Structures:** Learned how to define and instantiate Swift structs, and understood their role as value types.
- **Swift Classes:** Created Swift classes to manage object-oriented programming concepts and understood their role as reference types.
- **OOP Principles:** Applied object-oriented programming principles to enhance code organization and reusability.
- **Refactoring:** Improved code readability and maintainability by applying refactoring techniques.

## Usage

1. **Launch the App:**
   - Open the app on your iOS device or simulator.

2. **Answer Questions:**
   - Read the question and select the correct answer from the multiple-choice options.

3. **View Results:**
   - Receive immediate feedback on your answer and see your progress.

## Code Overview

### Models

- **Question.swift:** Defines the Question struct used to represent each quiz question.

### View Controllers

- **ViewController.swift:** Manages the user interface and handles user interactions.

### Helpers

- **QuizBrain.swift:** Manages the quiz logic, including tracking the current question and score.
